## üìù Instructions

1. **Rename your photos** to match the exact names above
2. **Use .jpg format** (or .png, .jpeg will also work)
3. **Keep file sizes reasonable** (under 2MB each for faster loading)
4. **Use square photos** if possible (they'll look best in the circular frames)

## üîÑ Adding Photos Later

If you don't have all photos now, the family tree will show initials instead. You can add photos anytime by:
1. Adding the photo file to this folder
2. Renaming it to match the list above
3. The family tree will automatically display it

## üì± Photo Tips

- **Good lighting** - well-lit photos look best
- **Clear faces** - make sure faces are clearly visible
- **Recent photos** - use recent photos when possible
- **Consistent style** - similar photo styles work well together
